## Managing WordPress, plugins and themes
WordPress and theme/plugin packages available through [wpackagist](https://wpackagist.org/) can be updated using composer.

To update a specific package:
```
composer update vendor/package:version
```

To update all packages (if using a flexible version range):
```
composer update
```

### Installing plugins/themes
When installing themes or plugins first check it is available on wpackagist.

If so use composer to add the package to the project. 

```
composer require vendor/package:version
```

If not then add an exception in gitignore so that it can be added to VCS. Same applies for custom plugins and themes.
```
!/html/wp-content/theme/theme-name
!/html/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name
```
